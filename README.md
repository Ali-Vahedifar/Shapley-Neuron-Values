## The Problem

Neural networks are notorious for **catastrophic forgetting** — teach a model something new and it overwrites what it already knew. Replay buffers help, but they're expensive, don't scale, and sometimes aren't even allowed (think GDPR). Architecture expansion works too, but the model keeps growing.

We asked a different question: *what if the model already has everything it needs, and we just need to figure out which parts matter?*

## Our Approach

**Shapley Neuron Valuation (SNV)** borrows a 70-year-old idea from cooperative game theory — the [Shapley value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value) — and applies it to neurons. Instead of treating all neurons equally or making binary keep/discard decisions, SNV computes a *fair* importance score for every neuron by measuring its marginal contribution across all possible subsets of the network. The important neurons get frozen; the rest stay plastic for the next task.

No replay buffer. No extra parameters. No task labels at test time (in the Class-IL setting). Just a smarter way of deciding what to protect.
